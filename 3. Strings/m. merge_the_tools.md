To solve the problem, the goal is to split the string `s` into substrings of size `k` and process each substring to remove duplicate characters while preserving their order.

Here’s how to approach the solution:

### Steps:

1. **Divide the string** `s` into substrings of length `k`. Since `k` is guaranteed to be a factor of the length of the string, each substring will have exactly `k` characters.
   
2. **For each substring**, create a new string `ui` that includes each character only once in the order it appears in the substring. If a character repeats, it is ignored after its first occurrence.

3. **Print the result**: For each substring, print the corresponding string `ui` after duplicates have been removed.

### Example:

Given `s = "AAABCADDE"` and `k = 3`:

- Split the string into substrings of length `k`:
  - Substring 1: `"AAA"`
  - Substring 2: `"BCA"`
  - Substring 3: `"DDE"`

- For each substring:
  - `"AAA"` → Remove duplicates → `"A"`
  - `"BCA"` → No duplicates → `"BCA"`
  - `"DDE"` → Remove duplicates → `"DE"`

- The output should be:
  ```
  A
  BCA
  DE
  ```

### Code Implementation:

```python
def merge_the_tools(s, k):
    # Iterate over the string in chunks of size k
    for i in range(0, len(s), k):
        # Get the substring of size k
        t = s[i:i+k]
        
        # Use an ordered set approach to remove duplicates while maintaining order
        u = ""
        for char in t:
            if char not in u:
                u += char
        
        # Print the resulting string u
        print(u)

# Example usage
s = 'AAABCADDE'
k = 3
merge_the_tools(s, k)
```

<!-- ### Explanation:

1. **String slicing**: `s[i:i+k]` takes substrings of size `k` as we loop through the string in steps of `k`.
   
2. **Removing duplicates**: We create an empty string `u`. For each character in the substring `t`, we check if it is already in `u`. If it isn’t, we append it to `u`.

3. **Printing the result**: After processing each substring, `u` is printed.

### Output for the example:

```
A
BCA
DE
```

This solution efficiently splits the string, removes duplicates, and prints each result in the required format.

Consider the following:
• A string, s, of length n where s COCI cn 1
• An integer, k, where k is a factor of n.
We can split s into substrings where each subtring, ti, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s.
Then, use each ti to create string ui such that:
• The characters in ui are a subsequence of the characters in ti.
• Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in ui occurs
exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index j in ti occurs at a previous index < j in ti, then
do not include the character in string tLi.
Given s and k, print lines where each line i denotes string tLi.
k
Example
s 'AAABCADDE'
There are three substrings of length 3 to consider: 'AAA', 'BCA' and 'DDE'. The first substring is all 'A' characters,
so ul The second substring has all distinct characters, so u2 'BCA'. The third substring has 2
different characters, so ug 'DE'. Note that a subsequence maintains the original order of characters
encountered. The order of characters in each subsequence shown is important.
