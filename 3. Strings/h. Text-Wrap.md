the `wrap` function can be valuable:

### 1. **CLI Tools and Scripts**
   **Scenario:** You are developing a command-line tool that provides users with detailed help information. The help text is long and needs to be formatted neatly within the terminal's width.

   **Use Case:** Ensure that the help text is readable by wrapping it to fit within 80 characters.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   Usage: mytool [OPTIONS]
   
   Options:
     -h, --help       Show this help message and exit.
     -f FILE          Specify the input file to process.
     -o OUTPUT        Specify the output file location.
   
   Description:
   This tool processes input files and generates output files
   according to the specified options. It supports various
   formats and can be customized using additional flags.
   ```

### 2. **Log Formatting**
   **Scenario:** Logs are generated by an application, and the log messages can be very long. You need to ensure that these log messages are readable when viewed in a text editor or log viewer.

   **Use Case:** Format log messages to fit within 100 characters to avoid horizontal scrolling and make them easier to read.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   [INFO] [2024-08-18 12:00:00] Process started successfully. This log message is
   intentionally long to demonstrate the text wrapping functionality that ensures
   the message does not exceed the specified width, making it easier to read.
   ```

### 3. **Automated Reports**
   **Scenario:** An automated report is generated by a CI/CD pipeline, and it needs to be formatted neatly before being sent via email.

   **Use Case:** Wrap text in the report to fit within 70 characters for better readability in email clients.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   Deployment Summary:
   
   - Application: MyApp
   - Status: Successful
   - Duration: 5 minutes
   
   Details:
   The deployment of MyApp was completed successfully with no
   errors encountered. The application is now running version
   1.2.3 on the production environment.
   ```

### 4. **Configuration and Documentation Tools**
   **Scenario:** You are generating a configuration file where each line should not exceed 80 characters to comply with formatting standards.

   **Use Case:** Wrap lines in the configuration file to adhere to the width constraint.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   [server]
   address = 192.168.1.1
   port = 8080
   timeout = 30
   max_connections = 100

   [logging]
   level = INFO
   file = /var/log/myapp.log
   ```

### 5. **Text-based User Interfaces (TUIs)**
   **Scenario:** A text-based user interface displays user instructions and messages within a fixed-size window.

   **Use Case:** Ensure that all text is wrapped properly to fit within the window size of 40 characters.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
   Welcome to MyApp!
   
   To get started, use the following commands:
   - `start`: Begin the application.
   - `stop`: Stop the application.
   - `status`: Check the current status.
   
   For help, type `help` and press Enter.
   ```

### 6. **Email Templates**
   **Scenario:** An automated system sends plain-text emails with updates and notifications. The email content should be wrapped to fit within 72 characters for better readability across different email clients.

   **Use Case:** Format the email content to ensure it displays properly without horizontal scrolling.

   **Output Example:**
   ```
